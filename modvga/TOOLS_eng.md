# htobin.py (.h --> .bin)
The `htobin.py` script compiles GameDuino header files (.h) containing ressources to binary files (.bin). The .bin files can then be loaded by MicroPython onto the GameDuino board.

The `gd.py` library did deprecate the `copy()` (which copy data from Arduino's Flash Arduino to GameDuino) and replace it by `copybin()` (copy the binary file content to  GameDuino)

## Use case
Many Gamesuino examples are using ressource stored into the Arduino's Flash by using a header file (.h).

With the example (01_basics/sprite256/sprite256.h)[../1_basics/sprite256/sprite256.h] the header file looks to:

```
static flash_uint8_t sprites256_pic[] = {

0x00,  0x00,  0x00,  0x00,  0x00,  0x00,  0x00,  0x00,  0x00,  0x00,  0x00,  0x00,  0x00,  0x00,  0x00,  0x00,
0x00,  0x00,  0x00,  0x00,  0x00,  0x00,  0x00,  0x00, ...
                              ... 0x00,  0x00,  0x00,  0x00,  0x00,  0x00,  0x00,  0x00,  0x00,  0x00,  0x00,
};
```

Transform this content into MicroPython code creates a quite too large python script to be parsed on a microcontroler. As a result, the content could not be transform in byte code. The best would be to have a ressource like for Arduino but not in Flash but into a file (which achieve the same results).

Final solution is to create a binary file which exactly math the bytes encoded in the header file.

So here the HEX content of `sprite256_pal.bin` file matching the `static flash_uint8_t sprites256_pal[] = {` declaration in the (01_basics/sprite256/sprite256.h)[../01_basics/sprite256/sprite256.h] file (_the header file can contains several ressources_)

__Encoded such a way, the data can be made available in the MicroPython filesystem (so also in Flash!).__

## How htobin.py does works

[00_basic/htobin.py](00_basic/htobin.py) is a python3 script to execute on your computer (we are using Linux or Raspberry-Pi).

It inspect the header file (.h) named in parameters and creates as many `XXXXXXXXXX.bin` binary files as there is `static flash_uint8_t XXXXXXXXXX[] = {` declaration in the header file. Notice that data CANNOT SHARE the same line of the openning or closing statements.

The .bin files are created in the same directory than source header file (.h).

In the case of the (01_basics/sprite256/sprite256.h)[../01_basics/sprite256/sprite256.h] exemple, the `htobin.py` commands will look to

```
$ ./htobin.py ../01_basics/sprite256/sprites256.h
```

which will produce the following output (plus the files):

```
Openning sprites256.h ...
Writing sprites256_pic.bin ...
4096 bytes written
Writing sprites256_chr.bin ...
3808 bytes written
Writing sprites256_pal.bin ...
1904 bytes written
Done!
```

## Reload .bin -> Gameduino

Here is the snip of code used to reload a .bin content (example comming from  [01_basics/sprite256/spr256.py](../01_basics/sprite256/spr256.py) )

```
# Openning the ressource file as read (r) and binary mode (b)
# The 'with' statement would automatically release the file ressource asap
with open( 'sprites256_pic.bin', 'rb' ) as f:
	# Copy the file content to GameDuino starting from address RAM_PIC (0x0000)
	gd.copybin( f, RAM_PIC )
```
